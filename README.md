# Neural Networks Lab Assignments
Assignments for ECE NTUA Neural Networks Course 2020

## Lab 1 - Supervised Learing
The goal of this lab is to evaluate different classifiers, such as Dummy, Gaussian Naive Bayes, kNN, MLP and SVM with two different dataset (solar and ISOLET) from [UCI Machine Learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).

## Lab 2 - Unsupervised Learning
The goal of this lab is to develop a movie recommender system.The dataset we will be working with is based on the [Carnegie Mellon Movie Summary Corpus] (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/). First, we implement a content-based film recommendations system. In the second implementation. we will rely on the topological properties of Self Organizing Maps (SOM).

## Lab 3 - Deep Learning
The goal of this lab was to familiarize ourselves with the deep neural networks architectures. The task was Image Classification on a subset of the CIFAR-100 dataset. We also used Transfer Learning on some well known architectures and on the state-of-the-art EfficientNets. Moreover, apart from Transfer Learning we had to build some models "from scratch" for the same task. The first part was to build the architecture for some models and tried the best models of them on the problem . The second part was the optimization part when we applied some techniques that target to help with some difficulties that our model may face such as Overfitting , Training Time and Memory Usage.
