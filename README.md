# Neural Networks Lab Assignments
Assignments for ECE NTUA Neural Networks Course 2020

## Lab 1 - Supervised Learing
The goal of this lab is to evaluate different classifiers, such as Dummy, Gaussian Naive Bayes, kNN, MLP and SVM with two different dataset (solar and ISOLET) from [UCI Machine Learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).

## Lab 2 - Unsupervised Learning

## Lab 3 - Deep Learning
