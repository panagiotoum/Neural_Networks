# Neural Networks Lab Assignments
Assignments for ECE NTUA Neural Networks Course 2020

## Lab 1 - Supervised Learing
The goal of this lab is to evaluate different classifiers, such as Dummy, Gaussian Naive Bayes, kNN, MLP and SVM with two different dataset (solar and ISOLET) from [UCI Machine Learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).

## Lab 2 - Unsupervised Learning
The goal of this lab is to develop a movie recommender system.The dataset we will be working with is based on the [Carnegie Mellon Movie Summary Corpus] (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/). First, we implement a content-based film recommendations system. In the second implementation. we will rely on the topological properties of Self Organizing Maps (SOM).

## Lab 3 - Deep Learning
The goal of this lab is to optimize the performance of Deep Learning models as a whole CIFAR-100 data using the TensorFlow 2 library. We define new models,
from scratch ("from scratch") and by transfer learning.
